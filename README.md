# Rim73 1.4

This is my first mod for own tutorial. I was using it for personal performance improvement, but I made this repository because I wanted to share it with other modders and people who think like me.

This mod contains a fix from the abandoned rim73 project's github repository to include all possible features compatible with 1.4.

Also includes a super destructive and stupid Verse.Pawn.Tick() replacement patch by removing ticks from enemy Pawns

At least in my environment, it boosts performance a bit, but in many cases my patch may take away a player from immersion and turn Rimworld from a "story generator" into a skill tester or defense game.

But personally, I had a lot of fun while tweaking this mod, and I'm sure someone else somewhere on the planet could too. (Thanks Ghost_Rolly!)

*I do not own the code of this repo. If requested by the code owner, Ghost_Rolly, this Github will be removed immediately.

**Please use this mod at your own risk.

#### FAQ:

# Q: Is Rim73 1.4 compatible with OOO mod?
A: Unfortunately, this is WIP project and I haven't done extensive testing of existing code. That's why I will not put it on the workshop. Known incompatibilities (Anty, Dragonian, SOS2) may still exist.
